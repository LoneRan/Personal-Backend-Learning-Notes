# Personal-Backend-Learning-Notes
The intention of building this repository is to record what I've learned and make a copy for me to reveal. Plus, I hope this can push me to forge my personal skills. 

These notes will focus on some backend resources and knowledge and of course there might be some crossing aspects related to backend. I will dig into these as well.

Even though it's a personal learning note I set it to be public. if someone reads this, I'll be honored and if you can point out the mistakes or give me a little incite, it will be great!
