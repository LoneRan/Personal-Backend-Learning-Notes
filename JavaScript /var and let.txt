# var and let
var is kind of old school way of initialize a variable. Usually var and let is basically the same, user can replace var by let, vice versa. 

There are also some slight difference between var and let:

- "var" can tolerate redeclaration
If we use let to declare same variable twice, that's an error!
```
let var1;
let var1; //SyntaxError: 'var1' has already been declared.
```

- "var" can be declared below their use:
```
function sayHi() {
	phrase = "hello";
	alert phrase;
	var phrase;
}

sayHi();
```
