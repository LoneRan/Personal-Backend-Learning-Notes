# Arrow Ruction
An arrow in javascript creates a function which accepts argus and then evaluates the expression on the right side with their use and return its result.

```
let func = (arg1, arg2, ... argN) => expression
```
Which is equal to 
```
let func = function(arg1, arg2, ... argN) {
 return expression;
};
```
