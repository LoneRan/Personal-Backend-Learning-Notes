# Callback
Many functions in javascript allow user to schedule asynchronous
Actions.

Due to that, it's very common that we write asynchronous
Functions in our code, in that case, it's impossible to do that:
```
loadScript('/my/script.js'); //the script has "function newFunction() {...}"

newFunction(); //no such function!
```
Then add call back to solve this situation:
```
loadScript('/my/script.js', function(){
//the call back runs after the script is loaded
	newFunction();
	...
});

```


In function, a callback is expected to be "called back" later if necessary.
