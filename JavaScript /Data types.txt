# Data types
1. String:
```
 let str = "hello";
 let str2 = 'single quotes are ok too';
 let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;
```
 In JavaScript, double and single quotes are the same, when using backticks(`), we can put other things like string or calculations in ${} and get the correct string. But it doesn't work in double and single quotes.
2. Number
 The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.  <br />
3. Objects
 //Objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entitles
```
 let user = new Object(); //"object constructor" syntax
 let user = {]; // "object literal" syntax
```
 _Tips: Except Objects, other seven data types are primitive, meaning there is only one line code for them_

## Now Focus on Objects
An object can be created with figure brackets =={..}== with an optional list of properties. A property is a *"key:value"* pair.

```
let user = {
	name: "John",
	age: 30
}

```
Property values are accessible using the dot notation:
```
alert (user.name); //John
alert (user.age); //30
```
We add an item by simply:
```
let user = {];
user["like birds"] = true;
```
### in operator in Objects
```
let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };
alert("age" in user); //true
alert("balboa" in user); //false
```

The "for...in" loop
